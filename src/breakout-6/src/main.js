/**
 * Breakout-6
 * The "High Score" Update
 *
 * Original Lua by: Colton Ogden (cogden@cs50.harvard.edu)
 * Adapted to JS by: Vikram Singh (vikram.singh@johnabbott.qc.ca)
 *
 * Originally developed by Atari in 1976. An effective evolution of
 * Pong, Breakout ditched the two-player mechanic in favor of a single-
 * player game where the player, still controlling a paddle, was tasked
 * with eliminating a screen full of differently placed bricks of varying
 * values by deflecting a ball back at them.
 *
 * This version is built to more closely resemble the NES than
 * the original Pong machines or the Atari 2600 in terms of
 * resolution, though in widescreen (16:9) so it looks nicer on
 * modern systems.

 * The state machine we'll be using to transition between various states
 * in our game instead of clumping them together in our update and draw methods.
 *
 * Current game state can be any of the following:
 *   1. 'title-screen' (the beginning of the game, where we're told to press Enter)
 *   2. 'play' (the ball is in play, bouncing between paddles)
 *   3. 'serve' (waiting on a key press to serve the ball)
 *   4. 'game-over' (the player has lost; display score and allow restart)
 *   5. 'victory' (the current level is over, with a victory jingle)
 *   6. 'high-score' (displays all the high scores)
 *   7. 'enter-high-score' (player got a high score and can enter their name)
